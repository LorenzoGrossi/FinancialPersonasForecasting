**Implementation of an Agent-Based Recommendation System Using Time-Variant Markov Chains**

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my master's thesis, "Implementation of an Agent-Based Recommendation System Using Time-Variant Markov Chains: Investor Personas Forecasting and Business Case Application".

*Overview*

The thesis explores the use of time-variant Markov Chains to model and predict customer behavior over time, specifically in the context of agent-based recommendation systems. This methodology focuses on improving strategies for financial and insurance product offerings by forecasting future investor personas and addressing their needs with targeted business cases.

*Key Components*

Agent-Based Framework: Simulates customer behavior and interactions to provide dynamic, flexible recommendations.
Time-Variant Markov Chains: Models the evolution of customer clusters and incorporates probabilities to predict future transitions.
Monte Carlo Simulations: Used to estimate transition probabilities and analyze variations across different models.
Business Case Development: Demonstrates practical applications of the forecasting model in financial and insurance domains.
Features
Modular and customizable implementation of Markov Chains for time-based clustering.
Integration with Monte Carlo methods for robust probability estimations.
Insights into strategy optimization for product recommendations.
Applications
This framework extends beyond financial contexts, offering potential adaptability for various sectors requiring customer behavior analysis and prediction.
